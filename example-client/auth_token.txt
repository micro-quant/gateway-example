NOTE: Remove all contents of this file and replace it with the JWT created directly from microquant

This can be done by creating an AUTH_TOKEN in a particular microquant environment and then creating a python function inside the app 
that simply prints the AUTH_TOKEN.

How to Create an AUTH_TOKEN:
    1. Navigate to the environments page (https://app.microquant.io/environments)
    2. Select any environment you have access to
    3. Select the "Auth Tokens" tab
    4. create a new token configuration called "EXAMPLE" with the JWT claims: {"aud": "microquant.io"}
    4a. The aud token here b/c that is what we validate against; when you configure your API you will configure it with different validation and this aud token should match your API

How to retrieve a token with these configurations:
    1. Navigate to the new functions page (https://app.microquant.io/functions/_private/_new)
    2. Create and then run the following function:

        import os

        def handle() -> str:
            return os.getenv("AUTH_TOKEN_EXAMPLE")
