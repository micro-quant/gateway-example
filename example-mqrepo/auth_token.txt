NOTE: remove all contents of this file and replace it with the JWT created directly from microquant

This can be done by creating an AUTH_TOKEN in a particular microquant environment and then creating a python function inside the app 
that simply prints the AUTH_TOKEN.

For example, if you create the AUTH_TOKEN "EXAMPLE",
you can get the generated value by creating and running this code:

import os

def handle() -> str:
    return os.getenv("AUTH_TOKEN_EXAMPLE")
